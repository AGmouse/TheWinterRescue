## Contributing
You can do the translations on your local path, Just copy `en_us.json` or `zh_cn.json` and modify to your own language. If you finished, just make a pull-request to our project and we would review and merge asap.  
You can use any tool or editor if you like, just keep the json file pretty formatted so anyone else could easily edit it.
